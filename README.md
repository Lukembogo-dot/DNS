# DNS

Working through this TryHackMe challenge gave me a deeper understanding of how DNS works 
and why it’s so important to how we use the internet every day. What initially seemed like a 
simple system for matching names to IPs turned out to be a complex, layered, and highly 
efficient process involving multiple servers and caching mechanisms. I learned how DNS 
simplifies human interaction with the web by translating domain names into IP addresses, and I 
explored the structure of domains — including TLDs, second-level domains, and subdomains. I 
also gained clarity on various DNS record types like A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, and TXT, and how 
each serves a specific role in directing internet traffic and services.
